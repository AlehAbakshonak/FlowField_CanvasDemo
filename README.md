# FlowField_CanvasDemo
Demonstration project for drawing particles moving through noise, using only JS Canvas methods.

The Russian-language stream related to this demo can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bzkq7CEPVIU

I do not own the rights to the Simplex.js and p5.js libraries, I just use them for demonstration purposes.
